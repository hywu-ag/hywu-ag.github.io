Iâ€™m now a PhD student at the School of Mathematics, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Zhiyuan Li. I mainly work on algebraic geometry and my research interests include

- Moduli space of sheaves/vector bundles/complexes
- Moduli space of varieties (hyperk\"{a}helr, log Fano pairs...)
- stability conditions
- algebraic cycles
- Hodge theory
  
For details, you can see the pdf version of my [CV](/files/CV-Haoyu Wu.pdf).
