Iâ€™m now a PhD student at the School of Mathematics, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Zhiyuan Li. I mainly work on algebraic geometry and my research interests include

- Moduli space of sheaves/varieties (especially moduli of sheaves on K3 surfaces, moduli of K3's and log Fano pairs) 
- Birational geometry and stability conditions
- algebraic cycles and Hodge theory

  
For details, you can see the pdf version of my [CV](/files/CV-Haoyu Wu.pdf).
